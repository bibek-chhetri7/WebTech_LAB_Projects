    <p>Abraham Lincoln is generally regarded as one of the greatest president of the U.S. His most famous speech is,</p>
     <blockquote cite="https://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm">
       "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
       Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Whatever one's opinion of Lincoln, no one can deny the enormous and lasting effect he had on the U.S.</p>
